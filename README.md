# param

`param` makes use of Go generics to streamline table-driven testing to more
closely resemble so-called "parameterized tests" in other languages.

Table-driven testing in Go is a notoriously tedious and vertically noisy
necessity. The aim of this library is to eliminate as much as possible
vertical line noise and boilerplate in test files such that tests are
easier to read and less tedious to write.

See the test files for examples of `param` in use.
